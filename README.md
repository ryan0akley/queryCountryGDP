# queryCountryGDP
This project querys the APIs of every country's GDP between two years that the user inputs in the console, sorts them from greatest to lowest GDP from the last year, and saves all of the GDPs in a CSV file.
Execute main.py in the command line terminal with the following interface:
```
gdp --from-year [year1] --to-year [year2]
```
Where [year1] is the starting year and [year2] is the ending year.

The final result should be printed out in the terminal in CSV format and saved in a CSV file called "output.csv".
